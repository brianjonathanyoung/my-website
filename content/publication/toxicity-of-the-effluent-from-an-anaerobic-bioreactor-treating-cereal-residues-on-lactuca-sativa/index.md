abstract: "Effluents generated during the process of anaerobic digestion should
  be treated before their disposal into the environment. The aim of this study
  was evaluating the effectiveness of the effluent treatment system from an
  anaerobic bioreactor, assessing the toxicity reduction with the Lactuca sativa
  seed germination and root elongation inhibition test. Three sampling points
  were selected along the effluent treatment system: inflow into the first
  treatment pond, outflow from the third pond and recirculated flow to the
  bioreactor. Effluent dilutions tested for each sampling point were 25% and 50%
  (v/v), undiluted sample and controls. The pH, conductivity, temperature,
  dissolved oxygen, BOD5 and COD were measured. The decrease in the organic and
  inorganic loads was correlated with a reduction in the phytotoxicity. The use
  of the seed toxicity test allows evaluating the quality and effectiveness of
  the studied effluent treatment system."

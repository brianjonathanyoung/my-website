abstract: Egg production has increased worldwide and, consequently, there is a
  large volume of poultry manure generated. The principal egg production systems
  are the caged ones, namely the conventional and the automated. The aim of this
  study was to evaluate the temporal variability of the physico-chemical,
  microbiological, and parasitological properties of poultry manure from both
  systems. Three conventional and four automated farms were studied. The main
  variables analyzed differed significantly between systems. Poultry manure from
  conventional system had the highest values of pH, total solids, C:N,
  phosphorous, sulfate, selected cations, and some microorganisms and parasites.
  Poultry manure from automated system had the highest values of electrical
  conductivity, volatile solids, nitrogen content, and soluble fraction of Ca,
  Mg, and Mn, among others. The lowest temporal variability of the measured
  parameters was observed in the automated system. Overall, all measured
  parameters, except nitrogen, had their highest values in the warmest season.
  The presence of pathogen microorganisms and parasites and the Na and Zn
  concentrations indicate that a special management before soil application
  should be considered. This study could contribute to the development of
  management strategies for poultry manure in each system, such as control of
  ambient conditions within the facilities and waste treatment.

abstract: "Both raw and composted poultry manure is applied as soil amendment.
  The aims of this study were: (1) to develop phytotoxicity indexes for organic
  wastes and composts, and (2) to assess the correlation among phytotoxicity
  indexes, ecotoxicological endpoints and stability and physicochemical
  parameters during passive composting of poultry manure. Six 2-m3 composting
  piles were constructed and four parameter groups (physicochemical and
  microbiological parameters, ecotoxicological endpoints, and biological
  activity) were determined at four sampling times during 92 days. Extracts were
  used to carry out acute toxicity tests on Daphnia magna, Lactuca sativa and
  Raphanus sativus. Composting decreased average toxicity 22.8% for the 3
  species and D. magna was the most sensitive species. The static respiration
  index decreased from 1.12 to 0.46 mg O2 g OM h−1 whilst organic matter reduced
  by 64.1% at the end of the process. Escherichia coli colonies remained higher
  than values recommended by international guidelines. The D. magna
  immobilization test allowed the assessment of possible leachate or run-off
  toxicity. The new phytotoxicity indexes (RGIC0.8 and GIC80%), proposed in this
  study, as well as salinity, proved to be good maturity indicators. Hence,
  these phytotoxicity indexes could be implemented in monitoring strategies as
  useful ecotoxicological tools. Multivariate analyses demonstrated positive
  correlations between ecotoxicological endpoints (low toxicity) and biological
  activity (stability). These two parameter groups were associated at the final
  sampling time and showed negative correlations with several physicochemical
  parameters (organic and inorganic contents). The final poultry manure compost
  was rendered stable, but immature and, thus, unsuitable for soil amending."

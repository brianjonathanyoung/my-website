abstract: "The effects of 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) on sex ratio, gonopodium
  morphology, and gonadal histology of C. decemmaculatus were assessed by a
  full-lifecycle exposure experiment. Newborn fish were waterborne exposed to
  30, 100, and 300 ng EE2/L for 90 d, using 50 fish per treatment. Additionally,
  in December of 2016, a field survey was conducted on a C. decemmaculatus
  population inhabiting the Girado Creek downstream of the Chascomus city
  wastewater effluent discharge. After 90 d of exposure, EE2 was able to
  histologically skew the sex ratio toward females and inhibit the full
  gonopodium development since the lowest tested concentration (LOEC = 30 ng/L).
  At higher concentrations, EE2 was toxic, inducing mortality in a
  concentration-dependent fashion (90 d-LC50 = 109.9 ng/L) and altering the
  gonadal histoarchitecture, causing neither testes nor ovaries discernible
  histologically (LOEC = 100 ng/L). In addition, a novel response, perianal
  hyperpigmentation, was discovered been induced by the EE2 exposure in a
  concentration-dependent fashion (90 d-EC50 = 39.3 ng/L). A higher proportion
  of females and perianal hyperpigmentation were observed in wild fish collected
  from the Girado Creek. The major reached conclusions are: i) EE2 induce
  different effects on the sexual traits of C. decemmaculatus when exposed from
  early-life or adult stages. ii) The most sensitive effects observed in the
  laboratory occur in a creek receiving wastewater effluent. iii) The perianal
  hyperpigmentation comes-up as a promising biomarker of exposure to estrogenic
  compounds."

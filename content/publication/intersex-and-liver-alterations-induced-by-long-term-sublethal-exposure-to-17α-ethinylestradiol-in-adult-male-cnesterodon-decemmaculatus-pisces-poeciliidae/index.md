abstract: The aim of the present study was to assess the responses of the
  gonopodium morphology and the gonadal and liver histology of adult male
  Cnesterodon decemmaculatus to sublethal long‐term exposure concentrations of
  17α‐ethinylestradiol (EE2). Two experiments were conducted exposing the fish
  to waterborne concentrations of EE2 ranging from 20 ng/L to 200 ng/L for 8 wk,
  12 wk, and 16 wk. Intersex gonads were observed after 8 wk and 16 wk in fish
  exposed to 200 ng EE2/L and 100 ng EE2/L, respectively. Oocytes’ development
  from testis germ cells and replacement of the efferent duct periodic
  acid‐Schiff–positive secretion surrounding spermatozeugmata by parenchymal
  tissue and duct structure alterations were the major observed changes in the
  gonads. In contrast, no response was observed in the gonopodium morphology.
  Liver histology was also altered, showing increasing steatosis, single‐cell
  necrosis to generalized necrosis, and disruption of acinar organization from
  100 ng EE2/L to 200 ng EE2/L. In summary, the present results showed that
  although EE2 was not able to alter the morphology of a developed gonopodium,
  it was capable of inducing development of testicular oocytes in adult male C.
  decemmaculatus at environmentally relevant concentrations. Thus, externally
  normal but intersex C. decemmaculatus males would be expected in the
  wastewater‐receiving streams that the species inhabits. According to the
  literature, the present study would be the first indicating estrogen‐induced
  intersex in adult male poeciliid.

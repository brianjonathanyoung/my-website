abstract: "Pulp and paper mill wastewater (PPMWW) contains high concentrations
  of recalcitrant compounds that cause toxicity to organisms. Advanced oxidation
  processes (AOPs) have the ability to degrade these compounds and reduce
  overall toxicity. Physicochemical characterization and Lactuca sativa toxicity
  test were conducted to compare the effectiveness of two post-treatments:
  UV/H2O2 and photo-Fenton. A comparison of four phytotoxicity indexes was
  carried out. PPMWW from a Brazilian treatment plant was characterized by high
  values of phenols, color, integrated spectral area (ISA), and chemical oxygen
  demand (COD), and caused significant inhibition to seedling development. The
  use of both post-treatments allowed the removal of over 75% of phenols, color,
  ISA, and COD. Although UV/H2O2 was more effective in removing phenols and ISA,
  photo-Fenton better reduced phytotoxicity. The most sensitive phytotoxicity
  indexes were RGIC0.8 and GIC80%, whereas SGC0, REC-0.25 and REC-0.50 better
  showed the effectiveness of the post-treatments. We suggest the combined use
  of two phytotoxicity indexes: one that evaluates the effects on seed
  germination and, another, on root elongation, e.g., SGC0 and RGIC0.8.
  Additionally, we recommend the use of ISA for monitoring programs of
  wastewater treatments because it is a cost-effective approach that allows
  narrowing down the search and identification of compounds present in complex
  mixtures."

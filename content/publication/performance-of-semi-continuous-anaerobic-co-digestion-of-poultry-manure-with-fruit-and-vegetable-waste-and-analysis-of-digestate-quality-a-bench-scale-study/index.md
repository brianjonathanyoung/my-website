abstract: "Poultry manure (PM) can contain ammonium and ammonia nitrogen, which
  may inhibit the anaerobic process. The aim of this work was to evaluate the
  performance of anaerobic digestion of PM co-digested with fruit and vegetable
  waste. Two semi-continuous bench scale (19L) stirred tank reactors were used.
  The operating conditions were: 34.5 °C, 2 gVS/L.d (organic load rate), 28 d of
  hydraulic retention time and 100 revolutions per m (1 h × 3 times by day) for
  the agitation. The reactors were fed PM and a mixture of PM and fruit and
  vegetable waste (FVW) at equal proportions (based on wet weight). The
  performance of the anaerobic process was assessed through biogas and methane
  yields, reduction of organic matter, release of nitrogen compounds and the
  monitoring of stability indicators (pH, volatile fatty acids (VFA), total (TA)
  and partial (PA) alkalinity). Moreover, the digestate quality was evaluated to
  determine potential risk and benefits from its application as biofertilizer.
  Toxicity was assessed using Daphnia magna immobilization tests. Results showed
  that biogas and methane yields from PM-FVW were 31% and 32% higher than PM
  alone, respectively. Values of organic matter, pH, alpha (PA/TA) and VFA
  revealed that stability was approached in PM and PM-FVW. The co-digestion of
  PM with FVW led to the highest methane and biogas yields, lower FAN and TAN
  concentrations, and a better digestate quality compared to mono-digestion of
  this manure."
